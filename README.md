# Machine Learning Assginments - Spring 2019

Assignments for the Machine Learning course at IIT KGP

### ASSIGNMENT 1 (Linear Regression)
Perform Linear Regression on a synthetically generated dataset using Gradient Descent. Use of various hypothesis function, cost function and learning rates.
Plots for curve fitting using various hypothesis functions and learning curves are attatched.


### ASSIGNMENT 2 (Decision Tree)
Perform classification using Decision Tree on a toy dataset as well as on a simplified version of "20newsgroup" dataset. Build the tree using Gini Index as well as Information Gain as the attribute-selection criterion.
Comparison of the algorithm with sklearn is shown in the assignment.


### ASSIGNMENT 3 (Clustering)
Perform Heirarchical Clustering using a) Single linkage, b) Complete linkage on a given dataset of accepted papers in AAAI.
Also perform Graph Clustering algorithm on the same dataset and compare with the gold standard data using NMI values.


### ASSIGNMENT 4 (Neural Networks)
Implement a simple Neural Network to classify messages a s SPAM or HAM. The specifications of the network are provided.  
Variation of train error, test error, and loss fucntion with number of epochs has been provided.
