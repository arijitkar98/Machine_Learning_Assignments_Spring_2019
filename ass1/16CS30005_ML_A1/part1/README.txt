To run the code for part 1 use the command:

python3 part1.py

The code first generates the dataset of size 10 as mentioned, 
then splits it into two parts, the test dataset and the train
data set of size 2 and 8 respectively and prints them.
It then calls the linear regression function for generating the
coefficients of polynomials of degree 1 to 9 and prints them.
It finally prints the test and train error for each degree polynomial.

##The training was done for 10000 iterations
