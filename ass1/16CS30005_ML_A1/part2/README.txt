The code for this part visualizes the datasets and also the curves.

To run the code use the command:

python3 part2.py

It will then ask the user to enter the size of the dataset to be generated.
For this part enter the value 10 as the size.

After generation of the datasets the code first plots the training and test set generated
and then the various curves generated.
It finally plots the test and train error vs the degree of the polynomial.

Figure 0 shows the dataset generated
Figures 1-9 show the polynomials of degrees 1-9 fitted on the data set
Figure 10 shows the plot of Error vs Degree

##The training was done for 10000 iterations
