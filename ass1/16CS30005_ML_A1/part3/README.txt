To run the code use the command:
python3 part3.py

The code generates the datasets and fits a polynomial of degree 3 for
datasets of size 100, 1000 and 10000.

Figures 0,2,4 show the datasets of size 10, 100 and 1000 respectively
Figures 1,3,5 show the polynomial of degree 3 fitted on datasets of sizes 10, 100 and 1000 respectively
Figure 6 shows the Error vs Dataset Size plot

##The training was done for 10000 iterations
